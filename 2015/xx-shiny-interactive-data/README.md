<div style='font-size:40px;'>Interactive data analysis with Shiny</div>

Overview
--------

In this tutorial we will explore the use of the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) 
to develop interactive data visualizations using in R.

Getting started
---------------

To begin, let's ensure that a recent version of Shiny has been installed. Open
an R console in either a terminal or in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), and
run:

```r
install.packages('shiny')
library(shiny)
```

Next, to test out the installation, we can launch one of the pre-packages Shiny
demos:

```r
runExample("01_hello")
```

If all goes well, a web page with an example Shiny application should be displayed either in your web browser, or
in an RStudio popup dialog.
