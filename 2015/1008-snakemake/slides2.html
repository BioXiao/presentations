# What is snakemake?
[Snakemake](https://bitbucket.org/johanneskoester/snakemake) is a *workflow
management system*.

Snakemake *workflows* are essentially Python scripts plus some declarative code
that define *rules*.

Rules describe how to create output files from input files.

When your script gets too unwieldy and you think *"there must be a better way"*
then it's probably time to use a workflow management system.
---

# Example use-case: complete RNA-seq analysis

Start with FASTQ files and a config file describing experimental design
- Trim reads (`cutadapt`)
- Map to genome (`HISAT2`)
- Evaluate rRNA and directional bias (`picard`)
- Remove multimappers (`samtools`)
- Count reads in genes (`subread/FeatureCounts`)
- DE analysis (`R/Bioconductor/DESeq2`)
- Run `cufflinks` (soon `kallisto`)
- FastQC at every stage
- Aggregate QC and results into HTML reports

End with HTML reports with links to final results, plots, stats, descriptions
ready to send to collaborator.

Most handle dependencies and only running those jobs that need updating.

Differences are in philosophy, syntax, features.

# Rules

A *rule* defines how to go from an input file to an output file.

Typically written in a file called `Snakefile`.

```python
rule sort:
	input: "words.txt"
	output: "sorted-words.txt"
	shell: "sort {input} > {output}"
```

Execute with:
```bash
snakemake
```

# Wildcards
Often we use wildcards in a rule

Ask for a file at the command line; snakemake will figure out what to do.

```python
rule sort:
    input: "{filename}"
    output: "sorted-{filename}"
    shell: "sort {input} > {output}"
```

Execute with:
```bash
snakemake sorted-words.txt
```


---
###How to think like snakemake
```bash
snakemake sorted-words.txt
```
--
Look in the current directory for a file called `Snakefile` and parse it.

--

Look for a rule whose "`output:`" matches the provided file, `sorted-words.txt`

--

```python
rule sort:
	input: "{filename}"
	output: "sorted-{filename}"
	shell: "sort {input} > {output}"
```
--

Use the discovered wildcards (here, `{filename} = words.txt`) to fill in `input`.

--

```python
rule sort:
	input: "words.txt"
	output: "sorted-words.txt"
	shell: "sort {input} > {output}"
```
--

Is `sorted-words.txt` missing? Older than `words.txt`? Run the rule, filling in
`{input}` and `{output}` as appropriate.

--

```bash
sort words.txt > sorted-words.txt
```

# Why snakemake in particular?

---
class: middle

## Parallelization is trivial

runs on single machine or cluster with *no changes to code*

```bash
snakemake  # one core
```

```bash
snakemake -j8  # 8 cores
```

```bash
snakemake -j100 --cluster "qsub"  # submit up to 100 jobs at a time, PBS/SGE
```
```bash
snakemake -j100 --cluster "sbatch"  # same, but SLURM
```

## Bash and Python can be used interchangeably

```python
rule sort_bash:
	input: "words.txt"
	output: "sorted-words.txt"
	shell: "sort {input} > {output}"
```
```python
rule sort_python:
	input: "words.txt"
	output: "sorted-words.txt"
	run: 
        with open(str(output[0])) as fout:
            for line in sorted(open(str(input[0]))):
                fout.write(line)
```

```python
rule sort_bash_from_python:
	input: "words.txt"
	output: "sorted-words.txt"
	run:
        print("starting to sort", input[0])
        shell("sort {input} > {output}")
        print("sorted", output[0])
```

# Other nice things

- Snakemake is an extension of the Python language. *Any valid Python code is
  valid Snakemake code*.

- Generate HTML reports.

- Temporary and protected files

- Create output dirs

- Diagrams showing the DAG of jobs to be run

- Tracking changes in code: you can detect when parameters changed

- Configure per-job resources (number of threads, cluster memory, etc)

- Call R via `rpy2`. (In practice, I tend to have separate scripts since `rpy2`
  can be finicky)
