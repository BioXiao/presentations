Notebook for today

I am working on trying out some fo the CNV tools availalbe to prepare for my talk on Tuesday.  

I am trying to install stuff on mason AND my computer because some tools dont' really work on OSX 
(this can be part of the talk).


#####  MY DATA ######

My test data (which is really experimental data) consists of two bam files, which are 1 of the nondrive
pools and the drive pool.  Some of the programs allow doing this sort of case/control analysis.  

There will be some variants from this data, as some of the tools require some prefiltering (Such as 
removing the concordant reads, for Hydra)

breakdancer and maybe some of the other programs require "read group data" if you want to compare
multiple samples.  I used a tool to ADD readgroup data because bwa does not include it by default (whoops).  

AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar is a picard java application (/Localapps/picard-tools-1.108/picard-tools-1.108/)

$ java -Xmx2g -jar AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar INPUT=TD_Gom12_Drive.a600.sort.bam OUTPUT=TD_Gom12_Drive.a600.sort.RG.bam RGID=1 RGLB=drive RGPL=ILLUMINA RGPU=1 RGSM=TdGD VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT
$ java -Xmx2g -jar AddOrReplaceReadGroups.jar INPUT=TD_Gom12_ND1.a600.sort.bam OUTPUT=TD_Gom12_ND1.RG.bam RGLB=nondrive1 RGID=2 RGPL=ILLUMINA RGPU=2 RGSM=TdGND1 VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT

##### CNVNATOR ###### 

I eventually got this to install apparently successfully on OSX BUT when I try to run it 
it will fail.  I will see if I have better luck on mason!

To install CNVnator you first have to install a program called root.  If you want to install this 
from source it's a pain.  There is a precompiled version for macosX but to get root to "work" on Mavericks 
you need to do some weird stuff because Mavericks doesn't have gcc anymore.  Then, you need to install 
CNVnator, and set environment variables before running it.  

Each time I want to run CNVnator on mason I need to set these variables as part of the PBS script:

export ROOTSYS=~/bin/root/
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/root/bin/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${ROOTSYS}/lib

Test data for CNVnator:
You need to include read group data for anaysis towork for CNVnator.  I used a tool to ADD readgroup 
data because bwa does not include it by default (whoops).  

Adding readgroup data:


Runnign CNVnator
This program is multi step.  This is kind of a pain since I need to write scripts to do it though I 
probably could do it all in 1 script I didn't.  I'll try that out sometime.  


#####  breakdancer  #####

http://breakdancer.sourceforge.net/

Breakdancer using Paired End information only in order to detect various types of CNVs.  It includes
options for comparing multiple libraries/samples, so it seems like it could be quite useful.

Installing and running on OSX

Overview: I had difficulty getting the C version fo breakdancer to install but ultimately I got an 
early perl version to work.  

(I downloaded BreakDancer_1.0 from the website becuase it includes the full perl version).

$ perl bam2cfg.pl ~/Desktop/GenomePaper/CNV_detection/TD_Gom12_ND1.RG.bam ~/Desktop/GenomePaper/CNV_detection/TD_Gom12_Drive.a600.sort.RG.bam > ~/Desktop/GenomePaper/CNV_detection/TdGom_DvsND_CNV.cfg 
$ perl BreakDancerMax.pl -g ~/Desktop/GenomePaper/CNV_detection/TdGom_DvsND_CNV.bed -d ~/Desktop/GenomePaper/CNV_detection/TdGom_DvsND_CNV.bed -r 5 ~/Desktop/GenomePaper/CNV_detection/TdGom_DvsND_CNV.cfg > ~/Desktop/GenomePaper/CNV_detection/TdGom_DvsND_CNV.breakdancer.out.txt 

Installing and running on mason:

I just downloaded a precompiled binary and it seems to run.  I uploaded the files that came out of 
bam2cvg.pl above, TdGom_DvsND_CNV.bed and TdGom_DvsND_CNV.cfg, however I changed the .cfg file to have the
proper paths:

/N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/

running breakdancer
breakdancer /N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/breakdancer/
