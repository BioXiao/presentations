Continuing to try to run the CNV tools.

##### CNVNATOR ###### 

The hist runs I did yetserday failed - the program (stupidly) requries you to split your reference 
into a single fasta file per chromosome.

I ran a perlscript I have (genesplit.pl) to create a directory of fastas.  Then rerun adding that dir:

cnvnator -root /N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/Td_Nondrive1.root -his 100 -d /N/dc2/scratch/joserein/genome_20k/

Then rerun the other PBS scripts ("stat", then "part" then "call")



##### Hydra ###### 

Instructions can be found: https://code.google.com/p/hydra-sv/wiki/TypicalWorkflow

I could not compile successfully on mavericks.  Installation was trivial on mason.  

Hydra only uses discordant readpairs but apparently is fairly sophisticated in how it uses them

Hydra requries a few steps of preprocessing to run.  First, do a regular alignment with bwa (or bowtie2 etc), 

Then pull out only discordant reads using samtools.

Then, use these reads as a dataset for a second alignment with a slower, more sensitive aligner.
They recommend novoalign which IS available as a module on mason (so include module add novoalign on PBS).

You can choose to do a third super sensitive alignment at this stage, or not.  

In order to figure out what values to use for the min and max insert size, as well as the deviation, 
(these are needed for two of hydra's scripts) I ran a picard program called CollectInsertSizeMetrics:

java -Xmx2g -jar ~/programs/picard/CollectInsertSizeMetrics.jar INPUT=/N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/TD_Gom12_Drive.a600.sort.RG.bam OUTPUT=/N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/TD_Gom12_Drive.picardstats.txt VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT HISTOGRAM_FILE=/N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/TD_Gom12_Drive.picardstats.hist

results:
						drive	nondrive
MEDIAN_INSERT_SIZE	        452	460
MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_DEVIATION   27	24
MIN_INSERT_SIZE	  	        1	1
MAX_INSERT_SIZE	 	        759622	1588806
MEAN_INSERT_SIZE	        435	429
STANDARD_DEVIATION	        76.1	87.5

Hydra's first script is pairDiscordants.py.  The -n option says how often a read should be allowed 
to hit.  It also requires a -z option for the  max concordant insert and -y for minimum.  
From the manual: "pairDiscordants.py allows you to set the upper (-z) and lower 
(-y) bound for concordants (this should be derived by plotting the alignment distance of your pairs 
and computing median and m.a.d. values)."

So... for my pairs, since there's little other guidance, I will take a shot in the dark and do
+/- 10*MAD for -y and -z

Hence:
for drive:
-i stdin -m hydra -z 722 -y 182 -n 1000
for nondrive:
-i stdin -m hydra -z 700 -y 220 -n 1000

The second script is dedupDiscordants.py and it seems to be just another filter, they only mention one
option -s nd not hwat it does.

Then, running hydra, 
e.g.: hydra -in sample.disc.deduped.bedpe -out sample.breaks -mld 500 -mno 1500

They say The -mld and -mno values are based on the statistics computed in tier 2. Use the Hydra help
(-h) to find suggested approaches for computing the values for these parameters.

-h says:

  -mld	Maximum allowable length difference b/w mappings.
  	Typically set to 10 * m.a.d. of the DNA fragment libraries.
  	see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation

  -mno	Maximum allowable non-overlap b/w mappings.
  	Typically set to median + (20 * m.a.d.) of the DNA fragment libraries.

OK for my data that would be:
drive: -mld 240 -mno 480
nondrive: -mld 240 -mno 480

I made a single script for each that would run these steps (everything after the first samtools filter)

~/scripts/PBSscripts/140425_Hydra_novoalign1/2.sh

OK hydra failed because (I realized) I need to first have my original bamfiles sorted byseq name rather 
than by position...

So I am going to "unsort" them as part of the samtools step

Then, I will run the multi step script again.

#######  SV_DETECT  #######

SV detect uses sam (not bam) files as input.  HOWEVER it requires for the SV mode to only have anomalously mapped
pairs, and for the CNV mode (depth) to only have correctly mapped pairs. 

I could try using the hydra input (since basicallyt he same thing is done), but why not try to script that comes with SVDETECT? 

BAM_preprocessingPairs.pl

Usage:   BAM_preprocessing_pairs.pl [options] <all_mate_file.sorted.bam/sam>

Options: -t BOOLEAN   read type: =1 (Illumina), =0 (SOLiD) [1]
         -p BOOLEAN   pair type: =1 (paired-end), =0 (mate-pair)  [1]
         -n INTEGER   number of pairs for calculating mu and sigma lengths [1000000]
	 	 -s INTEGER   minimum value of ISIZE for calculating mu and sigma lengths [0]
	 	 -S INTEGER   maximum value of ISIZE for calculating mu and sigma lengths [10000]
         -f REAL      minimal number of sigma fold for filtering pairs [3]
         -d           dump normal pairs into a file [<prefix.norm.bam/sam>] (optional)
	 	 -o STRING    output directory [working directory]

perl ~/programs/SVDetect_r0.8b/scripts/BAM_preprocessingPairs.pl -n 10000000 -d -o /N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/svdetect/ /N/dc2/scratch/joserein/CNVdata/TD_Gom12_Drive.a600.sort.RG.bam

SV_detect uses configuration files to run anything.  Example are included with the software.
